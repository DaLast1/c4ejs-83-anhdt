    <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicolson Baker's novel "<a href="#">The Anthologist</a>," scrawls in the margins of Oliver's "<a href="#">New and Selected Poems, Volume One</a>." A 
        struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the 
        long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke,
        Sara Teasdale - before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what i was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has 
        something."

            I don't know exactly what a prayer is. <br>
            I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down <br>
            into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass, <br>
            how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields, <br>
            which is what I have been doing all day.
        </p>
    </ul>

        The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.
